👋 Hi, I'm @empz (Emiliano Parizzi), a full stack software engineer with 15 years of experience designing, developing, and deploying
web applications. Experienced in leading remote teams to build, test and deploy robust and maintainable systems. Skilled in the whole spectrum of software development, from advanced
frontend techniques to backend architecture design and dev-ops pipelines. Passionate about learning, adopting cutting-edge technologies and optimizing the remote-based workflow.

🏖️ When I'm not doing software stuff,  I'm usually at the beach playing beach volleyball 🏐 or doing some scuba diving 🤿

💞️ I'm looking to be part of an amazing team at an amazing 100% remote and async company.
